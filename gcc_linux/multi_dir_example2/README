This version of multi_dir_example has Makefile in the top level dir, so vscode
can recognize w/o more config. The Makefile works with build/debug in vscode.

app is the target. It includes comp1_file1.h/comp2_file1.h/comp3_file1.h.
comp1_file1 has dependency on comp2_file2.
comp2_file1 has dependency on comp2_file2.
comp3_file1 has dependency on comp3_file2.

If do not use Makefile to build, use g++ directly under source/app:
g++ -I../comp1 -I../comp2 -I../comp3 -o app.out app.cpp ../comp*/*.cpp
