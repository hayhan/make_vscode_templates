This version of multi_dir_example has Makefile in the top level dir, so vscode
can recognize w/o more config. The Makefile works with build/debug in vscode.

app is the target. It includes comp1_file1.h/comp2_file1.h/comp3_file1.h.
comp1_file1 has dependency on comp2_file2.
comp2_file1 has dependency on comp2_file2.
comp3_file1 has dependency on comp3_file2.

If do not use Makefile to build, use g++ directly under source/app:
clang++ -g -I../comp1 -I../comp2 -I../comp3 -o app.out app.cpp ../comp*/*.cpp

For Makefile wherein "clang++ -c" and "clang++ -o" are separated, the debug flag
is in the former one, e.g. "clang++ -g -c", not the latter one.

Verified build/debug with clang++/Makefile in vscode on macOS.
